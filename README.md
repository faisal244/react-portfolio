## Description

Being a web developer means being part of a community. I need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share my work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

Using my new and ever growing React skills, I've created an updated portfolio and have delployed it to GitHub pages.

This new portfolio is built in React and features Sanity CMS acting as a backend Content Management System to allow for easy maintenance and updating of content in the future. The site also features extensive use of the Framer Motion animation library to add a sense of movement, dynamism and polish to the entire site.

Having used Three.JS on my previous portfolio site, I wanted to push myself even further with this latest project; to learn some new front end tools and technologies to go alongside my growing skillset in React, and i am proud of the end result here.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
